Selecting something that is replaceable or unnecessary can take the pressure off and open you up to experimentation and lower the impact and downsides of mistakes.",

      "DO NOT start by taking heirloom pieces or commissions from friends, the high stakes and stress can negatively impact your creativity. Leave room for learning and mistakes.",
      "If nothing stands out at home you can often find good starter pieces at a thrift store, garage sale, or online at a free or recycle centered community. Mentioning to friends and family what you are looking for might get you inundated with pieces, but be careful to check what strings are attached.",

      "Not necessarily! While Solid wood can be a good option, many excellent pieces of furniture make use of thin slices of expensive wood over cheaper woods. This wood veneer style can be delicate, but opens up some amazing options. Solid slab pieces can be expensive, heavy and prone to warping or bowing with weather.",

Don’t be afraid to walk away early on if you see flaking paint or suspicious repairs!",
