      "So you have a piece picked out and are staring it down to seperate where the strengths and weaknesses are. Do your best to note the best and worst that a piece has to offer while keeping in mind your style.",

      "This is a great time to clean your piece. Scrubbing off dirt and grime can reveal features worth keeping and expose repairs needed, but most importantly preps the furniture for the next steps. You do not want to be grinding oil, dirt and grime down into the pores of your surface! Use a degreasing soap and rinse with water.",

Problems will come up and flexibility to take things in a new direction can be key.",

Things that this piece has going for it, solid heavy wood construction with no MDF in sight and two nice sliding drawers. Things to grapple with, the slate center has definitely got to go and as well as the orangey stain color.",
